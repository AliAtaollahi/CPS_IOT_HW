# IoT-Based Entry and Exit Management System

## Project Overview

This project develops a system to control the entry and exit of individuals in a company using IoT technologies. The system utilizes RFID for identification and an Arduino board equipped with an ENC28J60 Ethernet module to handle door mechanisms and data transmission. A simple web server is implemented in the cloud to manage access permissions, and a monitoring system is set up to track and display entry events.

## Features

- **RFID Authentication:** Utilizes RFID sensors and tags to identify individuals entering or exiting the facility.
- **Arduino Control:** Manages door operations such as opening and closing based on authentication status using a servo motor.
- **Web Server:** Hosts a simple server in the cloud to store a list of authorized individuals and handle authentication requests.
- **Monitoring System:** A GUI monitoring system that displays entry events as they occur, developed using Qt and WebSockets for live data updates.

## System Setup

### Hardware Components

## Flowchart
<img src="CA1/Pics/Flowchart.png" alt="flowchart" width="50%">

The flowchart provides a visual guide to the sequence of operations when an individual attempts to enter the premises using our IoT-based Access Control System. Below is the detailed process as shown in the flowchart:

1. **Start (Setup)**: The system initializes and sets the RFID reader to standby mode, preparing to detect any RFID tag presented by an individual trying to gain entry.

2. **RFID Tag Detection**: When a person approaches, the system checks if the door is closed and then waits for an RFID signal. If a tag is present, it reads the information from the RFID tag.

3. **Data Handling**: Once the RFID reader detects a tag, it sends the data to the Arduino board, which then transmits this information to the cloud for authentication.

4. **Cloud-Based Authentication**: The cloud server receives the RFID data and authenticates the identity of the individual by comparing the received data against a list of authorized IDs.

5. **Response and Action**: Upon authentication, the cloud sends the identity information to the monitoring system, displaying all details and saving the event in the system's history. It also sends the authentication result back to the Arduino board to take the appropriate action.

6. **Access Control Decision**:
   - **Granting Access**: If authentication is successful, the Arduino commands the servo motor to open the door for 30 seconds, the LED indicator turns green, and the individualâ€™s information is displayed on the monitor.
   - **Denying Access**: If authentication fails, the system will not open the door; the LED indicator turns red, and an "Access Denied" message is displayed.

7. **Closing the Door**: If the door was opened, it is programmed to close automatically after 30 seconds or immediately if required for security reasons.

8. **End**: The flow concludes once the door is securely closed or the denied access protocol is completed.

void setup() {
  pinMode(GREEN_LED, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(RED_LED, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(RX_PIN, INPUT);
  pinMode(TX_PIN, OUTPUT);
  doorServo.attach(SERVO_PIN);
  doorServo.write(0);
  Serial.begin(9600);
  
  ether.begin(sizeof Ethernet::buffer, mymac, SS);

  ether.staticSetup(myip, gwip);

  ether.printIp("Server: ", ether.hisip);

  ether.clientWaitingGw();
  Serial.println("Gateway found");
  sendHandshake();
  Serial.println("Handshake completed");
}
```
Configures the GPIO pins and attaches the servo to its designated pin. Network initialization and diagnostic outputs are also set here.
Hereâ€™s a brief and focused explanation for each subject within our `setup()` function:  

**1. Selecting Pins** 
Configures GPIO pins for the LEDs and RX/TX pins, setting the directionality (input or output) for each.  

**2. Closing Door**   
Attaches the servo motor to its control pin and initializes it to a closed position, ensuring the door starts closed upon system reset.

**3. Initializing Serial and Ethernet Port**    
Initializes serial communication at 9600 baud rate for debugging and configures the Ethernet module with static IP settings.  

**4. Performing Handshake**   
Establishes a network route to the server, prints server IP for verification, waits for gateway availability, then sends a handshake to the server confirming network connectivity.

#### Main Loop
```cpp
void loop() {
  ether.packetLoop(ether.packetReceive());

  
  String receivedData = "";
  while (Serial.available()) {
    receivedData += Serial.readString();
  }
  
  // If the receivedData has data
  if (receivedData.length() > 0) {
    inputString += receivedData;
  }
  
  if (doorOpen) {
    // Check if 30 seconds have elapsed since the door was opened
    if (millis() - doorOpenTime >= 5000) {
      doorOpen = false;
      doorServo.write(0);
      digitalWrite(GREEN_LED, LOW);
      inputString = "";
    }
  }

    // If the receivedString has reached 10 characters
    if (inputString.length() == 10) {
        boolean sequenceResult = checkRFID(inputString);

      //boolean sequenceResult = checkSequence(inputString);

      Serial.println("  \n ");
      Serial.print("Sequence Check Result: ");
      Serial.println(sequenceResult ? "Correct" : "Incorrect");
      
      if (sequenceResult) {
        digitalWrite(GREEN_LED, HIGH);
        digitalWrite(RED_LED, LOW);
        doorServo.write(90);
        doorOpen = true;
        doorOpenTime = millis(); // Record the time when the door was opened
      } else {
        // If the sequence is incorrect, close the door
        digitalWrite(GREEN_LED, LOW);
        digitalWrite(RED_LED, HIGH);
        doorServo.write(0);
		    //const char jsonPayload[] PROGMEM = "{\"message\":\"hello\"}";
		    
        delay(500);
        digitalWrite(RED_LED, LOW);
        doorOpen = false;
      }
      inputString = "";
    }
}
```
Continuously reads RFID tags, checks them against server-side validation, and controls door access. Updates LED status based on authentication results. Here's a breakdown of the specific parts of the Arduino `loop()` function provided, detailing how it handles the RFID data received from the terminal, checks its validity, and manages access control logic based on the RFID check result:

**1. Receiving RFID from Terminal**
- **Network Data Handling**: Maintains the Ethernet connection and processes any packets that have been received.
- **Serial Data Collection**: Gathers all available data from the serial buffer, appending it to a string. This is presumed to be RFID data from a terminal.
- **Data Aggregation**: Adds newly received data to a cumulative string (`inputString`) if data is present.

**2.Validating and Checking the RFID** 
- **RFID Length Check**: Ensures that the `inputString` has accumulated exactly 10 characters, assumed to be the complete RFID sequence.
- **RFID Validation**: Calls `checkRFID(inputString)` to validate the RFID sequence. Outputs the result to the terminal for debugging.

**3. Handling Logic**  
- **For Correct RFID**:
  - **LEDs and Door**: Turns the GREEN LED on and the RED LED off, indicating access granted. Opens the door by setting the servo to 90 degrees.
  - **Time Tracking**: Marks the time the door was opened to check for auto-close timing.
- **For Incorrect RFID**:
  - **LEDs and Door**: Turns the GREEN LED off and the RED LED on, signaling access denied. Resets the door to a closed position by setting the servo to 0 degrees.
  - **Reset LEDs**: Briefly displays the RED LED before turning it off after a delay, preparing for the next access attempt.
- **String Reset**: Clears `inputString` to ready the system for the next RFID read cycle.

This detailed description maps out how the system handles each step of RFID data processing and the corresponding access control logic, ensuring clarity in how security and access are managed within the system.

### checkRFID Function
```cpp
bool checkRFID(String tag) {
  ether.packetLoop(ether.packetReceive());
  byte stash_desc = stash.create();
  stash.print("rfid=");
  stash.print(tag);
  stash.save();

  Stash::prepare(PSTR("POST http://$F/$F HTTP/1.1\r\n"
                      "Host: $F\r\n"
                      "Content-Length: $D\r\n"
                      "Content-Type: text/plain\r\n"
                      "\r\n"
                      "$H"),
                 website, PSTR("rfid"), website, stash.size(), stash_desc);

  byte session = ether.tcpSend();

  unsigned long startTime = millis();
  while (millis() - startTime < TIMEOUT_TIME) { 
    ether.packetLoop(ether.packetReceive());
    
    const char* reply = ether.tcpReply(session);
    if (reply != 0) {

      return true;
    }

  }

  return false; // no access
}
```
The `checkRFID` function sends an HTTP POST request containing RFID tag data to a server using TCP/IP communication managed by the EtherCard library. It waits for a server response within a specified timeout and interprets any received response as access granted, returning `true`; if no response is received within the timeout, it returns `false`, indicating access denied. This method effectively determines the authorization status based on server communication.Hereâ€™s an explanation of the `checkRFID` function that provides more detail on how the Arduino sketch sends HTTP requests using TCP and handles server responses to manage access control:

**1. HTTP Request Using TCP and Stash**
- **Buffer Preparation**: Begins by processing any received Ethernet packets. It then uses the `Stash` class to create a buffer for constructing the HTTP request. `Stash` is a utility for managing string and data storage in limited memory environments like Arduino.
- **Data Stashing**: Forms an HTTP POST request containing the RFID tag. It saves this string in the stash buffer and prepares an HTTP POST request.
- **HTTP Request Construction**: Constructs an HTTP POST request with headers and the RFID data as the body. This is formatted for the specific requirements of the server it communicates with.
- **Sending Request**: Initiates a TCP session to send the prepared HTTP request to the predefined server IP.

**2. Handling Server Response**
- **Response Waiting Loop**: Monitors for a response from the server within a specified timeout period. This loop also processes any incoming Ethernet packets during this time to keep the network interface active.
- **Response Evaluation**: Checks if any reply has been received for the TCP session. This implementation assumes any reply from the server indicates successful communication. 
- **Access Decision**:
  - **Access Granted**: If a reply is received, the function returns `true`, indicating that the server has recognized and processed the RFID data, implicitly granting access.
  - **No Access**: If no reply is received within the timeout period, the function concludes with `false`, indicating no access granted due to a lack of response or server acknowledgment.

### sendHandshake Function
```cpp
bool sendHandshake() {
  ether.packetLoop(ether.packetReceive());
  byte stash_desc = stash.create();
  stash.print("Handshake");
  stash.save();

  Stash::prepare(PSTR("POST http://$F/$F HTTP/1.1\r\n"
                      "Host: $F\r\n"
                      "Content-Length: $D\r\n"
                      "Content-Type: text/plain\r\n"
                      "\r\n"
                      "$H"),
                 website, PSTR("rfid"), website, stash.size(), stash_desc);

  byte session = ether.tcpSend();

  unsigned long startTime = millis();
  while (millis() - startTime < 5000) { // Timeout after 5 seconds
    ether.packetLoop(ether.packetReceive());

    // Flush the Ethernet buffer
    while (ether.tcpReply(session) != 0) {
      // Read and discard the data
      const char* reply = ether.tcpReply(session);
    }
  }

  return true;
}
```

The sendHandshake function in our code is designed to establish an initial communication session between the Arduino-based system and a server. This handshake is critical as it sets up a preliminary connection with the server, reducing the overhead for subsequent RFID tag transmissions by ensuring the communication channel is open and responsive. Hereâ€™s a breakdown focusing on the core components and their purposes:

### 1. **Packet Handling and Data Preparation**
- **Packet Processing**: Begins by processing any packets that have been received to keep the Ethernet interface active.
- **Stash Setup**: Utilizes the `Stash` class to create a temporary storage (stash) for the handshake message. This message is simply the string "Handshake".
- **HTTP Request Preparation**: Constructs an HTTP POST request using the stored "Handshake" message. The request is formatted with headers specifying the host, content length, and content type. 

### 2. **Sending the Request and Monitoring Response**
- **Sending Request**: Initiates a TCP session using `ether.tcpSend()` to transmit the prepared HTTP request to the server.
- **Response Handling**: Monitors for a server response over a fixed timeout period of 5 seconds. This loop ensures that the Arduino continues to process incoming packets during this wait period.

### 3. **Cleanup and Return**
- **Buffer Flushing**: Continuously checks for a reply within the given timeout. If a reply is received, it reads and discards the data to clear the buffer.
- **Function Exit**: The function returns `true` after the timeout period, regardless of whether a response was received or not. This implies that the handshake is considered complete after attempting to communicate, without verifying the success of the handshake explicitly.
